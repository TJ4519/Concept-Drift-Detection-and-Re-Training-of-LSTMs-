## Problem Statement

### Industrial Context

Predictive models play a **critical role** in industrial condition monitoring and failure prevention. However, **marine exhaust monitoring** introduces several challenges that conventional anomaly detection models struggle to address:

- **Concept Drift** – Soot accumulation, gradual wear, fuel variability, and operational changes cause evolving data distributions that degrade model accuracy over time.
- **Regulatory Compliance** – Maritime organizations require **interpretable AI models** with transparent decision-making processes.
- **Limited Bandwidth & Compute Resources** – Marine vessels operate in **low-connectivity environments**, requiring **optimized edge-based retraining and synchronization with shore-based systems**.

### Consequences of Model Drift

- **Undetected Exhaust Fouling** – Failing to account for drift can lead to inefficient fuel consumption, increased maintenance costs, and potential regulatory penalties.
- **False Alarms** – Misclassification of normal operational changes as anomalies can disrupt normal operations and erode operator trust in AI-based monitoring.
- **Model Instability** – If drift is not addressed, retrained models may overfit to temporary fluctuations, leading to performance degradation over time.

## Solution Overview

### Hybrid Drift Detection

The proposed framework integrates both **data-driven and physics-based** drift detection techniques:

- **Wasserstein Distance** – Used to track changes in the **LSTM reconstruction error distribution**, providing superior sensitivity in high-noise environments.
- **Arrhenius Activation Energy** – A thermodynamically interpretable feature that **directly relates combustion efficiency to changes in exhaust gas composition**.
- **Adaptive Thresholding** – Dynamically adjusts drift detection thresholds based on statistical and physical monitoring indicators.

### Adaptive Retraining Strategy

To maintain model accuracy and stability:

- **Rolling Window Retraining** – Periodically updates the model based on recent clean data, mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting.
- **Knowledge Distillation-Based Retraining** – The original pre-trained LSTM acts as a **teacher model**, ensuring that retrained versions do not overfit to transient conditions.
- **Multi-tier Model Updating** – Onboard systems handle **lightweight updates**, while full retraining occurs at shore-based facilities with access to historical data.

### MLOps & Compliance Considerations

- **Human-in-the-loop validation** ensures critical model updates undergo expert review before deployment.
- **Version-controlled rollback mechanisms** allow seamless reversion to prior models in case of instability.
- **Ship-to-shore model synchronization** optimizes bandwidth usage while maintaining up-to-date models across vessels.

## Key Technical Concepts

### Wasserstein Distance for Drift Detection

- **Outperforms KL and JS divergence** for detecting distribution shifts in noisy industrial environments.
- **Reduces false positives** in sensor-rich applications where traditional divergence metrics struggle with multimodal distributions.
- **Validated in turbine exhaust fault detection** and other industrial time-series anomaly detection use cases.

### Dynamic Normalization

- **Adaptive feature scaling prevents model degradation** due to long-term distribution shifts.
- **Rolling normalization with a 30-60x dominant time constant** minimizes overfitting while maintaining sensitivity to gradual drift.
- **Multi-resolution normalization strategies** help distinguish operational variability from true anomalies.

### Mechanistic Feature Engineering

- **Arrhenius Activation Energy** is a legally compliant and scientifically validated feature for tracking combustion efficiency.
- **Early indicators of heat exchanger fouling** reduce maintenance costs by detecting efficiency losses before critical failures occur.
- **Provides explainable monitoring metrics** for onboard engineers, aligning with regulatory standards.

### Retraining Strategy

- **Rolling Window Retraining:** Lightweight and adaptable to changing conditions.
- **Knowledge Distillation Retraining:** The original LSTM model acts as a knowledge-preserving reference, ensuring stable updates.
- **Gradient Regularization Techniques** mitigate catastrophic forgetting during retraining.

## Implementation & MLOps

### Onboard vs. Shore-Based Model Updates

- **Onboard (Edge AI):** Lightweight incremental updates reduce dependence on remote infrastructure.
- **Shore-Based (Cloud AI):** Full-scale retraining leverages historical data and regulatory-compliant validation.

### Resource Optimization

- **Model Pruning & Quantization** reduce latency and memory footprint for deployment on resource-constrained hardware.
- **Multi-Rate Processing** ensures efficient computation across different monitoring timescales.

### Compliance Considerations

- **Audit Trails & Model Versioning** align with **IMO MEPC.1/Circ.896** regulations.
- **Explainable AI Principles** ensure models remain transparent and interpretable.
- **Human-in-the-loop validation** prevents unintended model degradation and ensures regulatory compliance.

## Failure Mode Analysis
