# Concept-Drift-Detection-and-Re-Training-of-LSTMs-
An adaptive Machine Leanring playbook, with reccomended metrics and logic for LSTM retraining. Example used is from a real-world, predictive anomaly detection problem, where expected output data-distribtion would skew over time (soot-accumulation and heat-transfer related)
