## Problem Statement

Marine vessel exhaust monitoring is critical for early fault detection. Deep-learning models—such as LSTMs—are trained on sensor data (e.g., gas temperature) to predict normal operating conditions. Reconstruction errors (the difference between predicted and observed gas temperatures) are used to flag anomalies that may precede catastrophic failures (e.g., fires due to excessive soot buildup).

However, gradual changes in the exhaust system—such as the insulating effect of accumulating soot—cause the underlying data distribution to drift over time. This drift not only reduces model accuracy but can also mask critical anomalies. Our solution addresses these challenges by:

- **Enriching the Feature Set:** Incorporating additional signals (engine RPM, back-pressure, derived gas velocity) and deriving mechanistic features.
- **Robust Drift Detection:** Monitoring the full reconstruction error distribution (using metrics like the Wasserstein distance) alongside mechanistic parameters.
- **Automated Retraining:** Triggering retraining using a composite drift signal that selects a new dataset representing the current “normal.”
- **MLOps Integration:** Orchestrating the entire pipeline with robust versioning, logging, dashboarding, and automated retraining.

   - Retrain the LSTM (modified to accept enriched features and dynamic normalization) using a custom loss function that penalizes high reconstruction errors.
   - Version, validate, and deploy the new model using MLflow.

## Key Technical Concepts

### Dynamic Normalization

- **Concept:**  
  Update normalization parameters (mean, variance) on a rolling or batch-by-batch basis rather than using static, precomputed values.
- **Benefit:**  
  Adapts the model to shifts in the input distribution (e.g., due to soot buildup) and serves as an additional signal for drift.

### Composite Drift Detection

- **Concept:**  
  Fuse multiple signals—from reconstruction error metrics (mean, variance, Wasserstein distance) and mechanistic features (effective activation energy, effective gas constant)—into a single, robust drift metric.
- **Benefit:**  
  Provides a sensitive and reliable trigger for retraining by capturing average errors as well as changes in distribution shape and physical operating conditions.

### Mechanistic Feature Engineering

- **Concept:**  
  Leverage domain knowledge to derive features from sensor data:
  - **Arrhenius-Inspired Approach:**  
    Estimate an effective activation energy (\(E_a\)) that reflects changes in combustion or heat-transfer efficiency.
  - **Ideal Gas Law Approach:**  
    Derive an effective gas constant (\(R_{\text{eff}}\)) from gas temperature, engine RPM, and gas velocity.
- **Benefit:**  
  These interpretable, physically grounded signals complement statistical measures, offering deeper insight into the underlying process drift.

#### Mechanistic Feature Engineering Implementation

**A. Arrhenius-Inspired Approach**

1. **Data Collection:**  
   - Gather exhaust gas temperature (\(T\)) and a proxy for reaction rate (\(k\)) (e.g., normalized reconstruction error or another process-specific indicator).

2. **Linearization:**  
   - Transform the Arrhenius equation by taking the natural logarithm:
     \[
     \ln(k) = \ln(A) - \frac{E_a}{R} \cdot \frac{1}{T}
     \]
   - This yields a linear relationship between \(\ln(k)\) and \(1/T\).

3. **Estimation via Regression:**  
   - For each 15-minute batch, calculate \(1/T\) and \(\ln(k)\) and fit a linear regression model:
     - **Input:** \(x = 1/T\)
     - **Target:** \(y = \ln(k)\)
   - The slope \(m\) is used to estimate the effective activation energy:
     \[
     E_a = -m \times R
     \]
   - **Usage:**  
     A shift in \(E_a\) from its baseline indicates altered heat-transfer properties (e.g., increased insulation from soot).

**B. Ideal Gas Law Approach**

1. **Data Collection:**  
   - Collect gas temperature (\(T\)), engine RPM, and back-pressure (or gas velocity).

2. **Derivation:**  
   - Rearrange the Ideal Gas Law:
     \[
     R_{\text{eff}} = \frac{P \cdot V}{n \cdot T}
     \]
   - Here, \(P\) is estimated from back-pressure, \(V\) from gas velocity, and \(n\) is assumed constant.
   - **Estimation:**  
     Compute \(R_{\text{eff}}\) for each 15-minute batch and compare it to the baseline. Significant deviations signal a drift in the system's thermodynamic behavior.

**Integration:**  
- Log both \(E_a\) and \(R_{\text{eff}}\) over time and incorporate them into the composite drift metric alongside reconstruction error metrics.

### Modified Loss Function

- **Concept:**  
  Use a custom loss function (e.g., weighted MSE) that applies increased penalties for large reconstruction errors.
- **Benefit:**  
  Forces the model to learn a tighter representation of normal operations, making significant deviations a clearer signal of drift.

## Expert Commentary and Rationale

### Why Our Approach?

- **Domain Specificity:**  
  Our method leverages reconstruction losses from the LSTM—directly reflecting model performance—and augments these with mechanistic features derived from physical laws. This dual approach ensures that our drift detection is both statistically robust and physically interpretable.
  
- **Holistic Signal:**  
  The composite drift metric, which fuses statistical measures (including the Wasserstein distance) with mechanistic parameters, provides early, reliable detection of drift. This is critical when addressing safety-critical issues such as soot buildup.

- **Operational Robustness:**  
  By integrating dynamic normalization, enriched features, and a modified loss function into an automated MLOps pipeline, our solution adapts to evolving operating conditions while maintaining transparency and traceability.

### Preemptive Answers to Common Questions

**Concept & Architecture:**
- **Q:** *How did you decide to integrate both statistical metrics and mechanistic features for drift detection?*
  - **A:** Our decision was driven by the need for a robust, dual-layered signal. Statistical metrics capture changes in the reconstruction error distribution, while mechanistic features provide a physical interpretation (e.g., changes in effective activation energy or gas constant) that correlates with real-world phenomena like soot buildup.

- **Q:** *Why use the Wasserstein distance specifically for comparing reconstruction error distributions?*
  - **A:** The Wasserstein distance offers a holistic measure that captures differences in mean, spread, and shape (including skew and kurtosis). It quantifies the “cost” to transform the baseline error distribution into the current one, making it sensitive to subtle drifts that simpler metrics might miss.

**Dynamic Normalization & Data Handling:**
- **Q:** *Can you detail your dynamic normalization process?*
  - **A:** We update normalization parameters (mean and variance) on a per-batch or sliding-window basis. Each feature (gas temperature, RPM, etc.) is normalized individually to maintain consistency. This approach not only adapts to distributional shifts but also logs these parameters for drift analysis.
  
- **Q:** *How do you ensure data consistency and feature alignment, especially with time-shifted signals like RPM?*
  - **A:** We analyze cross-correlations between signals to determine appropriate time shifts. Once identified, signals (e.g., RPM) are aligned in the data preprocessing stage to ensure all features are synchronized across both historical training and live inference.

**Mechanistic Feature Engineering:**
- **Q:** *Walk me through the steps of estimating effective activation energy using the Arrhenius-inspired method.*
  - **A:** We:
    1. Collect temperature and a reaction rate proxy (\(k\)) from sensor data.
    2. Linearize the Arrhenius equation to obtain \(\ln(k)\) versus \(1/T\).
    3. Fit a linear regression to estimate the slope, from which we derive \(E_a = -m \times R\).
    4. Monitor shifts in \(E_a\) relative to a baseline as a drift signal.
  - **Pitfalls:** The method assumes a stable relationship; however, noise and non-ideal gas behavior can affect estimates. We mitigate this by aggregating over sufficiently large batches and cross-validating with other mechanistic features.

- **Q:** *How do you validate that the derived mechanistic features (e.g., effective gas constant) are reliable indicators of drift?*
  - **A:** We compare the estimated values against historical baselines obtained during normal operations. Consistent deviations—corroborated by rising reconstruction errors—indicate that these features are capturing meaningful changes in the system.

**Modified Loss Function & Model Retraining:**
- **Q:** *How did you design your custom loss function to penalize high reconstruction errors?*
  - **A:** We created a weighted MSE loss where the penalty increases with the magnitude of the error. This ensures that under normal conditions, reconstruction errors remain low; any significant increase is a strong drift indicator.
  
- **Q:** *Can you elaborate on the retraining trigger mechanism?*
  - **A:** Our retraining trigger is based on a composite drift metric that combines reconstruction error statistics (including the Wasserstein distance) with mechanistic feature deviations. If the metric exceeds adaptive thresholds over several consecutive batches, we select a recent, “clean” sliding window of data to retrain the LSTM, which is then validated and deployed.

**MLOps Integration & Operational Considerations:**
- **Q:** *Describe your experience integrating this pipeline with MLOps tools like MLflow and Airflow.*
  - **A:** We version both the feature store and model artifacts with MLflow, ensuring complete traceability. Automated jobs (scheduled via Databricks or Airflow) handle drift monitoring and retraining. We’ve built dashboards to visualize dynamic normalization parameters, reconstruction error metrics, and mechanistic signals—providing clear insights to stakeholders.
  
- **Q:** *How do you balance frequent retraining with model stability in production?*
  - **A:** Our approach uses adaptive, composite drift thresholds to trigger retraining only when sustained drift is detected. This minimizes unnecessary retraining and ensures the model remains stable while adapting to true changes in the data distribution.

**Evaluation & Future Improvements:**
- **Q:** *What methods do you use to simulate different drift scenarios, and how have these simulations influenced your approach?*
  - **A:** We simulate drift by gradually modifying the statistical properties (mean, variance, skewness) of the reconstruction error distribution—mimicking real-world changes like soot buildup. These simulations have guided our threshold settings and validated the sensitivity of the Wasserstein distance as a drift metric.
  
- **Q:** *Which additional drift detection techniques or adaptive normalization strategies might you consider?*
  - **A:** Future work may explore online learning methods for normalization, advanced ensemble drift detection (combining methods like ADWIN or Page-Hinkley), and deeper integration of physics-based models to further refine mechanistic feature derivation.

## Caveats and Considerations

- **Consistency is Key:**  
  Ensure that the new features and their normalization are applied consistently across historical and live data to avoid mismatches.
  
- **Dynamic Normalization Risks:**  
  While dynamic normalization adapts to changes, it may also mask drift if not logged separately.
  
- **Complexity Management:**  
  Incorporating mechanistic features and a modified loss function increases complexity. Each additional signal must be validated to ensure it reliably indicates drift.
  
- **Interpretability:**  
  Provide clear documentation and visualizations so that stakeholders understand how each signal (stati
