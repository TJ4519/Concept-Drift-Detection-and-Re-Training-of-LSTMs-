# Drift Detection & Adaptive Retraining for LSTSM based anomaly detection: Case Study in Marine Vessel Exhaust Monitoring

## Introduction

This document details an **industrial-grade solution** for managing **concept drift in industrial time-series data**, specifically tailored for **marine vessel exhaust monitoring**. The framework integrates **physics-based domain knowledge with advanced deep learning techniques**, ensuring **robust anomaly detection, adaptive retraining, and full compliance with maritime safety and emissions regulations**. The complexity of marine exhaust monitoring systems necessitates a **hybrid approach**, where mechanistic insights guide data-driven models to enhance **interpretability, reliability, and regulatory adherence**.

Marine exhaust systems present unique challenges such as **gradual fouling, sensor degradation, fuel composition changes, and operational variability**, all of which introduce long-term distribution shifts in sensor data. This concept drift, if left unaddressed, results in **increased false positives, missed anomalies, and declining model performance over time**. Our approach tackles these issues through a multi-tiered strategy that fuses **statistical drift detection, mechanistic feature engineering, and structured model retraining protocols**, ensuring that models remain **stable, accurate, and interpretable for industrial deployment**.

## Problem Statement

### Industrial Context

Marine exhaust monitoring plays a **critical role in vessel efficiency, emissions compliance, and safety**. However, the **dynamic operating conditions** in maritime environments pose substantial challenges for predictive models:

- **Concept Drift** – Gradual accumulation of **soot, sensor degradation, and fuel variability** cause shifts in the sensor data distribution, progressively reducing model accuracy.
- **Regulatory Compliance** – Maritime organizations demand **interpretable and explainable AI models** that can withstand regulatory audits and ensure safety-critical operations.
- **Connectivity & Compute Constraints** – Marine vessels operate in **low-bandwidth, high-latency environments**, necessitating **optimized edge-based retraining with intelligent shore-based synchronization**.

### Consequences of Model Drift

- **Failure to Detect Exhaust Fouling** – Unaddressed drift can lead to inefficient fuel consumption, increased emissions, and **maintenance costs escalating beyond budgeted thresholds**.
- **False Alarms & Operator Fatigue** – If normal operational changes are frequently misclassified as faults, onboard engineers may **lose trust in automated monitoring systems**, leading to **manual overrides or under-utilization of predictive maintenance tools**.
- **Model Instability & Overfitting** – Without structured retraining protocols, models may **overfit to short-term fluctuations**, reducing **generalization capabilities and overall system reliability**.

## Solution Overview

### Hybrid Drift Detection

The proposed framework introduces a **multi-layered drift detection strategy** combining **data-driven and physics-informed methodologies**:

- **Wasserstein Distance Tracking** – Detects **distributional shifts in LSTM reconstruction error**, offering superior drift sensitivity in **noisy, non-stationary environments**.
- **Arrhenius Activation Energy as a Drift Indicator** – A mechanistic parameter that correlates **combustion efficiency to drift-induced variations in exhaust gas behavior**.
- **Adaptive Thresholding** – Automatically calibrates drift detection based on the interplay between **statistical metrics and domain-specific thermodynamic properties**.

### Adaptive Model Retraining Strategy

To maintain robustness and long-term generalization:

- **Rolling Window Retraining** – Updates models based on recent **clean data windows**, ensuring gradual adaptation while preventing memory corruption.
- **Knowledge Distillation-Based Learning** – The **original LSTM acts as a knowledge source**, allowing new models to inherit prior knowledge while adapting to evolving data distributions.
- **Multi-tier Model Updating** – **Onboard systems handle incremental updates**, while full retraining is performed at **shore-based facilities**, ensuring the highest fidelity updates with minimal data transmission overhead.

### MLOps & Compliance Considerations

- **Human-in-the-loop validation** prevents **automated retraining from causing unintended regressions**.
- **Model versioning and auditability** align with **IMO and DNV guidelines**, ensuring regulatory acceptance.
- **Ship-to-shore model synchronization** balances **onboard autonomy with cloud-driven intelligence**, optimizing resource allocation.

## Key Technical Concepts

### Wasserstein Distance for Drift Detection

### Dynamic Normalization

- **Rolling normalization with a 30-60x dominant time constant** ensures **optimal drift sensitivity without masking true degradation trends**.
- **Prevents spurious anomaly detection** by accounting for gradual system changes rather than sudden perturbations.
